Bookprynt
=========
This program will give the correct order of pagenumbers that are needed to print a double paged booklet that can be stapled together easily, so the first sheet of paper will envelop the remaining ones. The output string can be copied and pasted into the printing window.

It will only work with an even number of pages to print. We will print 2 pages per sheet and obviously don't want to cut one of them. If you do not meet that requirement, consider adding a blank page at the end of the document.

In some cases it might be desirable not to print the title page because it will have to be flipped or something. Just enter the page number you want to start printing at.

Example: Your document has `13` pages and start with page `2` will result in `2,13,3,12,4,11,5,10,6,9,7,8`
