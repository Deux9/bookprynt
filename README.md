Bookprynt
=========
This program will give the correct order of pagenumbers that are needed to print a booklet that can be stapled together easily, so the first sheet of paper will envelop the remaining ones.

It will only work with even numbers.

Example: Input `12` will result in `1,12,2,11,3,10,4,9,5,8,6,7`
